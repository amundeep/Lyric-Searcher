You want a love, a love for us You want a selfless love That we can always say we trust, oh Love has always been a mockery Of those in love and scared to be in your need Don’t wanna love, don’t wanna hurt If all that loneliness requires Just another’s comfort Better off being all on your own There's a beauty in being alone Today we're arguing, it’s not worth making Another person that's just yours for the taking All your hoping and praying won't do more than saying that Love, love, love, love is just greed It’s almost taken me But now I can see Love, love, love, love is just greed A selfish little need You follow or you lead If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else? A love to us, a love to them It’s just a history repeating itself time and time again Love is not a veil to hide your voice All this talk of love just turns to noise So you want love, a love so tough But even honest truths don't seem as though they're adding up, oh Haven’t you already had enough What's this suffering remind you of? Someday we’ll all agree, it’s not worth making Another person that is yours for the taking All your hoping and praying won't do more than saying, that Love, love, love, love is just greed It’s almost taken me But now I can see Love, love, love, love is just greed A selfish little need You follow or you leave If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else? A love all gone is just another story Of what’s gone sour once was glory, glory, hey As soon as you want to ask of them Honey could you put your arms around me so Tell me things about you that I wouldn’t know And tell me that you love me like you do And maybe I will, too Love, love, love, love is just greed It’s almost taken me But now I can see Love, love, love, love is just greed A selfish little need You follow or you leave If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else?
